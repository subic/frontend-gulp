# Frontend gulp build tools

Script for a simple frontend build with some defaults which can be extended and customized. Optimizes css, images, html and JavaScript for production and creates a svg symbol sprite.

## Getting Started

#### Project setup

Clone or download the repository and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Customize the config variable in the [gulpfile](gulpfile.js) to your liking. An initial default folder structure can be setup by running:

```
npm run build
```

#### Running gulp

Default gulp task is optimized for production and includes browsersync with active file watching. Just run:

```
gulp
```

To prepare the production files (minimize, copy and remove sourcemaps and unused css definitions), run the production gulp task:

```
gulp production
```

For production, images are processed with imagemin which can take some time if source images are not optimized already.
